This is only example deploy stuff. Please modify to fit your needs.
To use this kit, just copy the whole folder into example root and run
docker-compose up (--force-recreate --build)
Use --force-recreate --build if you change any file which gets copied
into the docker.
The example docker-compose can be easily extended with e.g. nginx,
persitent database (remember, nothing is persitent in a docker container
as long you don't make it persistent). Best way making things persistent
is in my opinion with the volumes_from feature. If an example is needed,
feel free to open a new issue.

FAQ:

Q: Where is it running?
A: Inside the container the uwsgi is running on 0.0.0.0:8000 this is mapped
   via the docker-compose to the host on port 80.

Q: Why can't i see anything on localhost:80?
A: If you running on windows with virtualbox your machine creates a own ip
   You can check the ip with: docker-machine ip default
