# Elasticsearch 2015年03月简报

---

## Elasticsearch Updates
*	Elasticsearch 1.5.0 正式版发布了

*	考虑到Elasticsearch集群的稳定性，Elasticsearch的Rivers 功能将在elasticsearch 1.5.0后列入丢弃名单，在2.0后相关代码极有可能被完全移除。对应的river plugins 也不再支持。相信很多river plugins会逐渐演化成logstash input plugin。

## Elasticsearch Ecosystem Updates
*	elastic.co 收购了`Found.no`，一个圈内很有名的提供hosted elasticsearch 的saas服务公司。

*	kibana 4.0.1发布了

## Amazing Slides & tutorials & videos


## Meetups in China
